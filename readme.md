## Lessons Learned
During the development process of the Monte website, I learned several valuable lessons. Firstly, when working solely with HTML and CSS, it can be time-consuming to create a functional and interactive website. We encountered issues with embedding live streams from Facebook and wanted to include additional features like a map for tracking church locations and volunteer forms. With React, we were able to create objects and easily add events, making the task less tedious.

Another lesson learned was the importance of using components and classes to streamline the development process. After creating the initial static site using HTML and CSS, we moved on to develop the site using React. We used client-side routing, dynamic routing, and other optimization techniques to ensure faster load times and a better user experience. To improve the UI, we used a CSS preprocessor, SASS, to add variables and nesting, and we used mixins to group styles and conditional logic for different browsers. We also used Bootstrap and Tailwind for styling, with Tailwind being especially useful in creating a responsive design.

However, we encountered challenges with CSS classes becoming complex and difficult to manage. To solve this issue, we used module CSS and Tailwind, which eliminated the need to create individual class names. We also learned the importance of customized styles and the use of shadow, mix blend, and gradients. Finally, we added Next.js for SEO purposes and to ensure faster rendering times for the first contentful paint.
